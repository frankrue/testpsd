# Test PSD Website

> This is Frank Rue's response to a prospective opportunity in order to show
off development skill. **Please note** that **all** of the preprocessing,
setup, installations of [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) modules and [Bower](http://bower.io)
components have been done from scratch; I did not use a pre-fabricated setup
from someone else or from somewhere online.

## From Client (Requirements)

This is a desktop only view, breakdown is left to your interpretation. On a
'real' build this will never be the case, we do require the designers deliver
tablet/mobile PSDs as well. We won't be judging on any design elements, just
that it works and the code is clean. It can even have a unstyled unordered
list & solid background color! Very basic is okay.

Keep track of how long it takes to build, it helps us gauge where you're at.

## Few things we'll want to see:
- SCSS
- Component driven css organization
- Semantical HTML5 Mark Up
- Preprocessor (Gulp preferably)
- Bourbon / Neat
- Fully responsive (vs adaptive)
- Sticky Footer (so if the page is not tall enough it'll stay floated to the bottom)
- Slide out (from right) mobile navigation

## Would be impressed to see:
- Use of animate.css for navigation / to spicen up the initial load
- SVG sprites (symbol syntax)
- Touch events (swipe) to close navigation
- Dropped it into a repo
